# Piki — ActivityPub-federated wiki & note-taking local-first app

Piki is a hybrid of wiki and note-taking applications based on the ActivityPub protocol. Name Piki means that users PIck records for wiKI pages instead of editing the whole wiki page to make a change. Piki is wiki pages made from supported ActivityPub activities picked by a user itself and his/her friends.

Each user can fork and manage their own version of a page and readers can compare such versions to make their own decisions. Thus, for controversial topics there can be several points of view, instead of one compromise point of view.

Piki is built using the Local-First approach when a user has own pages locally on his devices and sync changes via an external service. Pages records and comments are stored in a local SQLite database that gives blazing fast fulltext and semantic (vector) search.

Piki supports ActivityPub federation. Users can follow page/topic versions, receive page updates and discuss them with other followers.

Our main outcome is a distributed Wikipedia, which is built on the Bazaar model instead of the Cathedral model.
