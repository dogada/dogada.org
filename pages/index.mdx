I create things mainly using Node.js, Typescript, React, SQL & NoSQL, Docker.

I'm interested in blockchain technologies, I believe that decentralization is the future and Bitcoin is the past.

One of my experimental projects Coect aims to create something like distributed Twitter (but without censorship) and Bitcoin (but with instant payments). You can find more details at: https://coect.dogada.org and https://fucr.dogada.org/.

I like meta-programming and prefer dynamic typing over static typing and believe that the best dynamic language isn't yet created. Once upon a time as an experiment, I even wrote a MetaJS compiler from LISP to Javascript that was able to guess a programmer's thoughts (more details at https://metajs.dogada.org).

I started with Java, then worked several years with Python/Django, but last years I prefer to use Javascript as the main programming language for both backend (NodeJs) and frontend (Angular, RiotJs, Svelte, React/Redux). On my Github you can find several javascript libraries for the NodeJs/React/Redux ecosystem.

My base project template (NextJs, Universal API, Postgres, Redis, Docker Swarm, PlayWright E2E testing) is available on GitHub: https://github.com/dogada/concepts.

After russia's invasion into Ukraine became intersted in EPS32 and low-latencey video processing on microcontrollers. Got some interestig results.

If you have any questions, please contact me for additional details.
