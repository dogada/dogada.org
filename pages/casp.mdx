# CASP (Content-Addressable Publishing)

CASP allows publishing any feed of records (Activity Streams, RSS, etc.) as a series of  
[Content Addressable aRchives](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/carv2/).  
This makes any publishing feed **highly available** because feeds are no longer bound to a single URL  
(or to a provider as an organizational entity) and can be uploaded to and downloaded from multiple hosts.

Each CASP feed is **blockchain-like in structure**, where the hashes of feed entries are signed by the author's private key(s).

Each feed has a [Decentralized Identifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/), and the corresponding DID document  
contains profile information and public cryptographic keys used to verify the authenticity of CASP feeds.

## Main outcomes of the project

- authors are not dependent on ActivityPub server admins and can publish content to several CASP hubs in parallel;
- no more migration issues between ActivityPub hubs — you own your data;
- the highly available CASP architecture mitigates the periodic downtimes of independent hubs and  
  makes the whole network rock-solid.

The CASP-powered [MultiSync](/multisync/) is used as the data-exchange backend for the  
local-first knowledge-management application [Piki](/piki).
